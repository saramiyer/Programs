The goal of this program is to recreate an ecosystem with fish, female bears and male bears. If the fish meet at the same coordinates, they reproduce.
If a female and male bear meet at the same coordinates, they reproduce and the sex of their offspring is randomly chosen.
If a fish and a bear meet at the same coordinate, the bear eats the fish.
If a bear doesn't eat a fish within a given time period, it dies. All characters move in random patterns.
