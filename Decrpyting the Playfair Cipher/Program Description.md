The goal of the program is to decipher a word which was encoded with the playfair cipher.

The Playfair Cipher is an encryption technique that performs substitution operations on pairs of letters using a keyword or phrase,
which is also used to decrypt the message.  

By performing a frequency analysis on a large encrypted 
text and a large English text, such as the War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells, the program
finds matches in the frequency of two-letter combinations. It replaces the matching two letter pairs in the encrypted word. 
Next, it takes a large dictionary of words and finds probable words that fit the partially
decrypted word. The program presents all the possible solutions for the encrypted word.

To run the program, download all the files into one folder.
